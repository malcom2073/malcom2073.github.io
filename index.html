      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a software developer, tinkerer, maker, gearhead, lifetime learner, and all-around nerd. I code for work and for fun, 
        with a focus on making life easier, both mine and others', by creating tooling and utilities for automation. 
        When I'm not writing code you'll find me playing with computers, video games, electronics, automobiles, 
        or any combination thereof.

      <h2>What I Do</h2>
      <p>
        I specialize in software development with a focus on automation and tooling that actually solves real problems.
        I love exploring new technologies, building custom solutions, and bridging the gap between hardware and software.
        From writing efficient code to wiring up electronics in project cars, I'm all about creating things that are 
        both innovative and genuinely useful.

        <h3><a href="https://wiki.mikesshop.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MikePedia</a></h3>
        <p>Automobile information! This is where I keep a variety of hard to find information about the vehicles
          I have and work on regularly. Everything from maintenance schedules to wiring diagrams to part numbers
          and more. It's a personal wiki that I use to document and share knowledge about cars.

        <h3><a href="https://photos.mikesshop.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MPhoto</a></h3>
        <p>My self-hosted photo management platform powered by Immich. A privacy focused alternative to 
        Google Photos where I store and organize my personal photography collection, from automotive builds 
        to everyday moments, all under my own control.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/malcom2073" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Projects</a></h3>
        <p>My collection of open-source projects, experiments, and tools. You'll find everything from automation 
        scripts and utility programs to hardware integration projects and anything else I'm actively tinkering with. 
        While most of the stuff is old, I find it's fun to look back on for new ideas and to help myself learn from past mistakes.</p>
